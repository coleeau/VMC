# Versatile Micro Computer

The Versatile Micro Computer (VMC for short) is a 6502 platform designed to be Powerful, expandable, and versatile

The VMC was designed as a project to express everything I have leared in electrical engineering,
and as a way to learn more concepts in electrical engineering, computer engineering and computer science

## Repository layout

- Hardware: KiCad files for the Hardware side of the VMC
- Reference: Reference documents
- Software: all sorts of programs
- Tools: Tools for testing


## Licensing

- Hardware: Global License applies to all files
- Reference: License depends on file. Global license likely applies to any non datasheet files.
- Software: Global License applies to all files outside of /3rd Party Software/ folder
- Tools: Global License does not apply to any file.
